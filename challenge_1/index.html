            <h2>Why we use the Normalize CSS Script</h2>
                <p>
                    Normalize CSS sets a baseline for your codes so when your website is pulled from different browsers, it would not be distored or altered.
                    All browsers have different CSS propoerties, which causes the distortion of your codes when pulled from different browsers.
                    However, using Normalize CSS, you are able to maintain your original format of your codes without getting them disturbed.
                    This is important because there are so many browsers that people user worldwide, and it would be an issue when your website is displayed differently depending on the browser.

            <h2>What is Semantic Markup</h2>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup is different tags that developers use in order to style contents without using stylesheet.
                    An example could be the use of h1, h2, and h3 to create visual hierarchy throughout the website, without manually setting different titles with different font sizes.
                    This not only simplifies the process of coding, but also is a great way of organizing the codes. 
                    Different semantic markup allows for easier spotting for different sections within the long document of codes.

            <h2>Using Images on Web Pages</h2>
                <img src="images/snowy.jpg" alt="Dog Image" width="450" height="600">
                <p>
                    The image is 450px wide, it is 600px tall, and it takes up 59KB on my disk.
