            <h2>Inheritance in CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    Inheritance in CSS controls elements that are not specified by the other CSS codes. For example, the <h1> tag would automatically make the content inside bigger and bolder than <p>, and <em> would italicize the contents inside the tags. Since inheritance applies to the codes when an element is not specified, it is able to become overriden by adding more specific codes in CSS.

            <h2>Specificity in CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    Specificity in CSS is what helps CSS decide what property to display on screen. Specificity calculates different CSS declaration weighs and declares any values that have a higher algorithmic weight. The difference between compound selector and multiple selector is that compound selector has a higher specificity, which means that it would override multiple selector if written together. Compound selector is able to point a specific element in the file, and you are able to create multiple selectors with compound selectors.

            <h2>ID and Class Attributes</h2>
             <p>
                In CSS, there are assign ID and classes, and the main difference is that you can only assign one ID to a single element, whereas classes could be used to assign multiple elements. ID can also be used to create internal links, which allows us to use IDs to create Table of Contents that is able to jump from one place to another within the page when clicked.
