        <h3>After reading <em>Game Design UX Best Practices</em></h3>
        <p>
            I think that the article was mostly focused on mobile games but I definitely learned new psychological decisions behind UI design! It was really interesting to find out how the buttons are intentionally positioned so that users have easier access to the desired button on the easier side. Not only that, I thought that the way advertisements were placed and timed are very specific; they do not allow users to exit the ad but it grants users with special prizes so they would keep watching the ads in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, this article went in dept about how to make users both comfortable and uncomfortable for the company's benefits. For example, the exit button could be hidden for the first few seconds of the onboarding video to purposely capture users' attention. Although this is not an ideal situation for the users, the game production (our client) would benefit from the designs that the designers made.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I read the article, I was able to compare my previous experience with my mobile games which was very exciting. Back when I was young, I played games as a leisure activity and did not think that many designers would have researched psychological factors and best practices behind all the decisions they have made for the game. The good thing about not only this article, but also other articles is that I am able to think more like a designer as I have daily interactions with devices. For me, getting first hand experience is important when I deeply understand concepts.

            <figcaption>Jennifer, 2023</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The image is a very short message that is from my mom. The interesting thing about this letter is that it is folded and seems like it has two layers of paper. There are actually many things that viewers woud not know since it is a simple photo. This letter is a UPS sticker letter that my mom sent me on my 21st birthday from Korea, along with flowers and a vase. The crease mark on the letter shows my effort to keep her letter safely in the box that I collect all my letters. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This image is related to my topic because my topic is about reminding viewers of all the people that they have loved and received love throughout their lives. For me, I moved back and forth between Korea and America so frequently that it was very easy for me to forget all the people that I had once created memories with. However, whenever I open my letter collection, I get reminded of all the friends and family members that told me "happy birthday," "I love you," "merry christmas," and "thank you."
            <br>
            <br>
            My archive of letters shows me that I am a great friend, lovable person, and thankful person for at least the people who gave me these letters. This gives me so much courage to live through such stressful time like now where I am doubting myself, feeling like I am not good enough, and being overwhelmed by my own future. As I always try to cheer people around me up no matter how stressed or sad I am, I would like to do the same with this project. I want to cheer up my visitors and tell them that they deserve all the love and gratitude they receive from people who loves them.

        </figure>
        <p class="additionalInfo">
            This image is a photograph of 5 hands holding an ice cream in the middle. It seems like Jamie was also part of the friend group and they went to get ice cream together during winter. I can see that it was during winter because of thick clothes and the date on bottom right corner.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most interesting part of the image is that it grabs my attention from the middle of the image, and the hands holding on to the ice cream slowly spreads my eyes towards the outside of the photo. I can also see that they all had favorite flavor in common, the white ice cream, and that they also preferred cone over cup. The photo is not only filled with closed up contents, but also has some pattern going on due to matching ice cream colors.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most obvious part of this photo is that they are all friends and that they are all happy at the moment; they just got their ice creams and they got it with people they like to hang out with. Mysterious part is their identity. We do not know who they are, how they look like, and what face they are making at the moment the photo was taken.

        <h3>After reading <em>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</em></h3>
        <p>
            It does not sound natural when you say that we <em>read</em> images. However, this article made me realize that when we view any type of photos we are always reading what is happening in the photo and analyzing with our own experiences. Although photo is a type of media that is static and biased, I believe that it provokes viewers' imagination and allows for them to understand different point of views from discussions. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I think that photos are biased in some way because it only shows a small portion of the whole environment and it is from the photographer's perspective. However, this is what makes it great for practicing thinking in others' perspective. It allows for people to think in certain way about the photo and when they discuss it with a group, they could learn something new.
            <br>
            <br>
            As designers, it is crucial to take different perspectives and empathize with the audiences to fullfill their needs. Not only that, I believe that perspective taking is also crucial for navigating this world since most of media we intake are somewhat biased. So, it is important for us to keep practicing visual literacy skills and protect ourselves from false and exaggerated information.

            The website that I found is from the awwwards.com, and it is a website by Falmec. The most interesting part of this website was screen's interactivity with the mouse, where the water wave would follow along the track of the mouse. Also, the overall scrolling experience is very smooth, which is also consistent with the sensation of water. There were also photos that helped explain their products, and those images also scaled according to the scroll direction. Overall, it was an immersive experience and greatly explains what they are trying to promote.

        <h3>After reading <em>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</em></h3>
        <p>
            The article goes in detail about what kind of modal design is effective and what is not. Few of the things that I remember is that there needs to be a descriptive title inside the modal, and the buttons need to be carefully worded. Unlike other UI designs for other parts of the website, I realized how wording greatly impacts the quality of user experience when interacting with the modals; users would heavily rely on words to navigate themselves within the modal.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I have interacted with websites, the modals often displayed subsriptions sign-ups, ongoing sale information, cupon retrieval, and more. The first impression of these modals are similar, but slightly different. Modals like cupons and sales immediately grab my attention and leads me to the specific page that the modal promotes. However, some modals that ask for subscription or sign ups usually negatively impacts my experience with the website, especially when I am in the middle of reading an article.
            <br>
            <br>
            After reading the article, I realized how small overlay on the screen could greatly determine the first impression of the website. However, now I have a question about timing of modal's appearance. Since surprising users with modals is not a good design, when should the user be introduced to the modals?

        <p class="date">01/26/2023</p>
        <h3>After reading <em>Best practices for form design</em></h3>
        <p>
            Reading the article made me consider designing   from the users' perspective once again. It is very interesting to think about how small features like multiple columns exhausts users when they fill out forms, and how the location of placeholder text could change users' experience with forms.
        <br>
        <br>
            Another thing I found intriguing from the article was auto focusing the first input field. I vaguely remember seeing these highlights in my personal interactions with forms, and it is surprising how these small visual cues just pass right through my thoughts. I think it is incredible that it is possible to design something that is so minimal, yet so impactful. After reading about this section, I once again thought that visual cues are much stronger than verbal cues and that it is the designers' job to utilize visiual cues to navigate users.
        <br>
        <br>
            When I first learned about creating forms, I was only nervous about creating something that I have never thought of creating. However, reading this article made me more enthusiastic about creating a form. I hope that I would be able to utilize information that I learned from this article into my future projects.

            I have recently visited Southwest Airlines website and thought that they have forms that is convenient for the users. For example, when the user inputs the desired airport name, it suggests nearby airpots as well. Also, when the user inputs depart date, the system automatically shifts to return date and shows them the calendar to click on the date of return.
