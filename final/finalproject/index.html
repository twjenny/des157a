                    One day, my sister ran to my classroom and she gave me this letter proudly as she said she wrote me a letter during class. I was happy that I received a letter from my sister, but when I took a close look at the letter and understand what she wrote, it was actually a threat message telling me that I should forgive her whenever she is mad at me. I still love her though.

                        After our last practice before our first competition of the season, my color guard team members wrote each other letter of affirmation to show that we appreciate each other for everything that we do during practice and performance, and also encourage each other for a great season.

                        My grandmother gave me this letter as an encouragement letter as my sister and I graduated from high school. We visited Korea during the summer break after my high school graduation and she wrote about how she was proud of us since babies and that she trusts that we will do well in the future as well.

                        It was my boyfriend and my 2nd anniversary and we celebrated at Malibu. I appreciated his letter very much because he is not an expressive person, but the things he wrote behind this message felt very sincere.

                        On my birthday, I received a package that my mom ordered from a floral shop. It had a clear vase, roses with other pink flowers, and this sticker letter. I was touched by her gift because I have not been able to celebrate my birthday with none of my family and this letter made me feel like my mom was with me on my birthday.
