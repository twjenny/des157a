    <h2>I have conducted user test with three classmates from DES157A class. The following articles were the research result.</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>User Tester 1: Kristian</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Focused on reading the word contents first, before viewing the image (noticed from the eye/head movement)</li>
                <li>Thought it was clean and put well together</li>
                <li>Did not like the hover feature that made the screen dim and light</li>
                <li>Said that the "scroll down" button was confusing because it was not consistent throughout the page</li>
            </ul>

    <article>
        <h3>User Tester 2: Emily</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Did not use the "scroll down" button at the beginning</li>
            <li>Liked the alternating positions of the word contents and the images</li>
            <li>Liked the "top" button because it allowed her to move back to top of the page more easily</li>
            <li>Suggested to make each sections highlight based on the page location, not hover</li>
        </ul>

    <article>
        <h3>User Tester 3: Erica</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Liked the dim-bright changes in different sections</li>
            <li>Liked how word contents were next to each other while showing the background (it sets the tone well)</li>
            <li>The small gap that is either on left or right of the word contents make it look like it has issues with viewport</li>
        </ul>

    <article id="conclusion">
        <h3>Common Findings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>"scroll down" and "top" buttons were easy to understand</li>
            <li>Liked the ripped effect of each photos (they said it made the contrast better from the background)</li>
            <li>The image was in an awkward position, covering parts of the word contents</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There were mixed opinion about having the screen go dim or bright, so I might either change how the effect is applied or the color of the effect</li>
            <li>The image was not positioned properly, so I would need to work on positioning the image</li>
        </ol>
